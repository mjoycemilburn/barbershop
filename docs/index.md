<p>The image below shows the online booking screen. The on-line booker is required to enter an email address for identification purposes and is then is able to select any available appointment time. The screen initially shows days with free appointments for a three-month period. Selecting a day reveals a detailed screen showing the free appointent slots on that day. Selecting a slot initiates a payment process. Successful conclusion results in the despatch of a confirmation receipt to the bookers email address.</p>

<p>The image below shows the configuration view of the online booking screen. This is initiated by calling booker.html with "mode" and "version" parameters - best achieved by interfacing it to a signon screen. Once entered, the screen offers six management options. The image below has been produced via booker.html?mode=viewer?ver=1.0 and displays the shop-managers view of the appointment book. This permits selection of a day/slot combination and displays the bookings that have been created for that slot as a popup overlay.
<p>The "Take Tel Booking" button allows the manager to take an unpaid telephone booking. The Change Booking button allows a booking to be switched to a different slot</p>

<p>The remaining buttons provide for configuration of the appointment book. "Set Bank Holidays" and "Set Staff Holidays" allow complete days to be blocked out and their operation is perfectly intuitive. The "Set Working Patterns" button is used to set the working patterns of each individual member of staff and is rather more complex</p>
